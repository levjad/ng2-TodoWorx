#Angular2 ToDo Learning Exercise

##Description
This is just a small exercise to learn more about Angular2 and angular-cli. Here you find the deployed app: [ng2-TodoWorx](https://ng2-todoworx.firebaseapp.com)

##Functions
So far the app can do following things:

 - Add / Remove Todo's
 - Checking that the field isn't empty (to prevent adding Todo's without title)
 - Todo's aren't save in a database (yet)  
 - Displaying the amount of Todo's

In future I want to add following functions:

- Filtering Todo's
- Saving to MongoDB
